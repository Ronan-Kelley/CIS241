	libCircle.o:

	a.out:

main.o's timestamp did not change, as main.c was not modified and as such did not have to be re-compiled; it simply had to be re-linked, which does not involve modifying the file itself.

	the timestamps of all of the files changed, but that is probably because I had to modify circleLib.c, as defining PI twice (once in the header file, once in the .c file) wasn't working since PI was defined as a constant.
